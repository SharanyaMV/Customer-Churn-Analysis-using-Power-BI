## **Beyond the Dashboard: Communication for Impact**
Besides making great dashboards, I also help clients understand the data and make smart decisions with it. By sending clear emails,
I:
- Shared important findings: Summarized data nicely focusing on what matters.
- Tailored messages: Adjusted my language to match the client's knowledge level.
- Suggested actions: Gave specific advice on what to do next.
